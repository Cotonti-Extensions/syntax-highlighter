## Color themes

Plugin bundled with a pack of [predefined color themes](https://github.com/syntaxhighlighter/syntaxhighlighter/wiki/Brushes-and-Themes#official-themes).
But you can adjust some of it to suit you needs with Cotonti theme colors. To do that copy theme CSS file from
`syntaxhighlighter/lib/styles` folder to your theme sub folder named `styles` â€” `themes/themename/styles`.
File name shoud have prefix `syntaxhighlighter-`. For example custom theme file full name can be like this: 
`themes/themename/styles/syntaxhighlighter-my-awesome-theme.css`.  
Now you can change it for your needs or create your own. All CSS files located in `themes/themename/styles` folder
override default ones with same names.
